# ChronoSeq: A Fair and Decentralized Layer 2 Blockchain Sequencer

ChronoSeq is a decentralized Layer 2 blockchain sequencer designed to enhance fairness, scalability, and security in transaction ordering. It leverages **Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs)** to ensure an unbiased, tamper-resistant, and decentralized transaction sequencing mechanism.

## Features
- **Decentralized Sequencer:** Eliminates central authority for transaction ordering.
- **Fair Transaction Ordering:** Uses VDFs to prevent frontrunning and MEV exploitation.
- **Optimized for Layer 2 Scaling:** Compatible with rollups like Optimistic and ZK-rollups.
- **High Performance:** Achieves low-latency and high-throughput transaction processing.
- **Golang Implementation:** Built using Go for performance and reliability.

## Installation
To get started with ChronoSeq, ensure you have **Go 1.19+** installed.

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/consensusys/Sequencer.git
cd Sequencer

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy
```

## Usage
To run the ChronoSeq sequencer, execute the following command:

```sh
go run main.go --config=config.yaml
```

### Configuration
ChronoSeq uses a YAML-based configuration file (`config.yaml`). Modify it to set parameters such as network details, sequencing policies, and logging preferences.

Example `config.yaml`:
```yaml
network:
  rpc_endpoint: "https://l2-network.example.com"
  chain_id: 420
sequencer:
  vdf_difficulty: 2048
  max_txs_per_block: 100
  consensus: "PoS"
logging:
  level: "info"
```

## API Endpoints
ChronoSeq provides a RESTful API to interact with the sequencer. Example endpoints:

- `GET /status` - Retrieve sequencer health and performance stats.
- `POST /submit_tx` - Submit a transaction to the sequencer.
- `GET /pending_txs` - View transactions awaiting confirmation.

## Development
To contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. Implement your changes.
4. Run tests: `go test ./...`
5. Submit a pull request.
